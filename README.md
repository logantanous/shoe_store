# Shoe Store

### By Logan Tanous

## Description
This program uses Active Record and establishes a many to many relationship with brands and stores. You can create multiple stores and assign the same brand to each or to a specific one.

## Specifications (use case scenarios)
<ul>
  <li>add, update, delete and list shoe stores.</li>
  <li>add and list new shoe brands. Shoe brands should include price.</li>
  <li>add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about updating, listing or destroying shoe brands).</li>
  <li>add existing shoe brands to a store to show where they are sold.</li>
  <li>associate the same brand of shoes with multiple stores. </li>
  <li>see all of the brands a store sells on the individual store page.</li>
  <li>store names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.</li>
  <li>the price is in currency format even if I just inputted a number. (In other words, typing in 50 should be updated to $50.00.)</li>
  <li>I do not want stores and/or shoe brands to be saved if I enter a blank name.</li>
  <li>I want all stores and brands to be unique. There shouldn't be two entries in the database for Blundstone.</li>
